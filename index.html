        While the MVP of your product is being planned from our location, we take full responsibility to teach you to
        market it prior to even the first lines of codes are written. As your MVP gets readied from our location with
        your remote team, and also customer-validated under our supervision, we proceed to help you understand the other
        non-product elements of that idea, the culture that will strengthen your startup.<br><br>
        An e.g. of that hustle isâââthe <a href="https://medium.com/preseed-web-lab/c68fd5dacc51">prelaunch
          marketing</a>, which we ourselves did for each of our own products before we went on to make them. <br><br>
        We need you to be under the same roof as us to teach you what we did with our products.<br><br>
        To sum up -:<br><br>
        1. You need to build a team of inspired hacker, designer and hustler per idea so that you can be incubated at a
        worthy startup incubator with your product.<br><br>
        2. You need to ensure that before the productâs single line is coded the product already has atleast 500
        pre-launch subscribers.<br><br>
        3. You need to ensure that the productâs MVP is working well for the early adopters.<br><br>
        4. You need to do all of this without burning a single penny because we believe web startups can be/should be
        MVPed at 0 monetary costs, just the way we did it for our products. <br><br> <b>The cost of infrastructure will be, however, born by Preseed Ecell till you are here with us.</b>
       <br><br>
        BTW, you are welcome to live with us for free, if you are a student with an obsession of the world of consumer
        mobile apps, and have the love for technology enough to learn how to code, design and market it, all nearly
        equally then this may be the best training ground for you. In short if we could define you as -: âa new age web
        hustlerâ willing to âdrop outâ of his college to help us build âPreseedâ over and above anything else, till you
        have an altruistic idea of your own.<br><br>
        I assure you the result of the knowledge you will garner here over a period of 1 year would empower you enough
        to build a technology startup of your own someday soon, and that too, with a very mature perspective.<br><br>
        Condition: Your entire focus must be on the strategies we are proposing. <br><br>

                          A school in delhi to educate those entrepreneurial spirited students who are forced to chase a
                          recognised education degree by their parents instead of building something. So we decided to
                          give them a degree that can further their cause, without them having to rebel against their
                          parents.
                          <br></br>
                          <b>Delhi Startup School:</b> This is what we are going to call it.
                          <br></br>
                          Guiding Principle -: All it takes is, being forever ready to reach out to anyone in the world
                          through the internet.
                          <br></br>
                          Over the last 10 years in Delhi I have come to realise that the culture of entrepreneurship,
                          even though is on the rise, still doesnât educate on the essence of simplicity, bootstrapping
                          and quick launch.
                          <br></br>
                          Anyway, that being the broader life skill we wanât be able to conclusively impart by running a
                          programme -:
                          <br></br>
                          <a href="https://medium.com/preseed-web-lab/c68fd5dacc51" target="_blank">
                            <h4>âMarketing Precedes Codingâ</h4>
                          </a>
                          <br>
                          (Do read the article linked with this heading). Some of the points of training students in
                          this specific field is that -:
                          <br></br>
                          1. Hackers can be found because hackers have enough tools on the web to learn hacking from
                          like on mentioned on this kippt list and enough platforms to shoot their queries to, to feed
                          on their curiosity. Moreover there are many programmes to train people in programing.<br>
                          2. Designers are those who are artists in their soul anyway. They will figure their route to
                          becoming designers anyway. They too have too many schools, programmes and online tools to
                          begin with.<br>
                          3. HustlerâââThis guy is the guy who is enterprising enough to go out there on the ground and
                          connect the dots. One of his main jobs is to be able to <b>market the idea</b> that he is
                          going out there to create. <b>We want to train this guy over how marketing is done in this new
                            age way even prior to the product is built.</b><br>
                          4. Above all, this is the chance for graduates to get in tune with the world their colleges
                          never taught them about. The world of building startups.<br></br>
                          So clearly this programme is for those who are specifically interested in learning digital
                          marketing for the purpose of product launches. For these guys truly understand the importance
                          of being able to launch their future idea even if there was little to no money to doing so.
                          <br></br>
                          We will essentially teach you about distribution of web and mobile apps through educating you
                          over -:
                          <br></br>
                          1. How were some of the most extraordinary companies built?<br>
                          2. What does the contemporary startup ecosystem of the world look like after the creation of
                          products like Angellist?<br>
                          3. What is a good idea?<br>
                          4. The tools that empower us in building a company.<br>
                          5. Above all, the new age ways of marketing because the web has become extremely social, thus,
                          changing the landscape of past ways of marketing still being taught in a lot of MBA
                          Schools.<br>
                          6. Above all we will teach you how to use the internet to learn.<br></br>
                          <b>We will train you over a period of 1 year and give you a degree in Masters in
                            Entrepreneurship.</b> We will put you through real job scenarios to give you good insights
                          into what it takes to really build something from technology to design.
                          <br></br>
                          Above all we would impart in you the culture Preseed is being built upon. In doing so every
                          member of the Preseed team will come forward to teaching you a thing or two. <b>Hence, every
                            one from the <a href="http://preseed.in/team" target="_blank">Preseed Team</a> is a mentor
                            here. These are the men you could learn from apart from our own set of educators hand picked
                            from the industry.</b>
                          <br></br>
                          Yes, we will give you a UGC recognized degree in Masters in Entrepreneurship too. However, if
                          you are really coming to us so that you could startup your own business really really soon,
                          you will never have to need your degree certificate.
                          <br></br>
                          The fees of the Programme is Rs. 1, 50, 000 per year.
                          <br></br>
                          I hope -:
                          <br></br>
                          I hope you understand we are training you not only for your job as a marketer at a good tech
                          startup, but to help you build one yourself someday.
                          <br></br>
                          I hope you also realise that if you are neither a designer nor a hacker and you still want to
                          be able to be a co founder in a tech startup right from itâs day 1, you need to be the guy who
                          can prelaunch it for customer validation the moment your productâs 1st version is ready. This
                          is the gap you will fill in the team of 2 people, one hacker and one designer, building a
                          product.
                          <br></br>
                          However if you are designer or a hacker, and yet wish to learn to distribute tech products on
                          the web, please join in. You will learn a lot beyond your current skills.

	<h4>Bootstrapping leads to simplicity.</h4>
Since little to no money is infused in the making of Preseed, it has remained bootstrapped to not even have set up an office space. Our offices are the homes/offices/coworking spaces/cafes where our collaborators sit, think and do. In fact we are bootstrapped to the extent that our core team gets built not out of monthly compensations but out of inspiration to chase a common goal with us. We have learned what it means to stay bootstrapped. It means to stay simple. It means toââânot be in a hurry.
<br><br>
Our appetite to not only stay bootstrapped ourselves but also keep our startups bootstrapped allows us to push ourselves to look for hacks in codes, in designs, in marketing, in hiring and overall business building. That, in turn, keeps our operational costs to an unbelievable low. That we think is a very important attribute of Preseed as a business organization made up of extraordinary hustle.
<br><br>
Basically we have begun to understand the importance of bootstrapping for ones growth as a leader. For, we have found ourselves to grow leaps and bounds since Preseed started in a moment of no penny even to pay phone bills. It led Nishchal to become simpler. We are pretty sure those lessons are leading his team to a path of simplicity, where a failure of business doesn't mean the failure of a human.
<br><br>
<h4>We once asked Nishchal, "what does simplicity lead to"?</h4>

I will explain that with an example of a moment of thought while trying to go into a state of meditation. When you close your eyes and imagine, you imagine with greater clarity, sometimes enough clarity to experience what you are imagining near visually. So basically all the visual noise of the outside vanishes when you shut your eyes. Now you are only imagining. There is no outside noise. So when you start becoming simpler and start shedding off the extra, this is what happens. The backdrop in which you imagine becomes clean and boundless. <b>Simplicity leads to boundlessness</b>.

			<p  style="font-size: 17px;">Design is more important than engineering in the consumer web space. One of the problems we see in this space in India is not of that of engineering. In fact India produces strong engineers. It's a problem of design, for India seriously lacks consumer web 'design' sensibilities. The reason stands - lack of geeks here marrying some seriously cool people. We hope that someday we are able to teach that to India through our products.</p>

			<h2>Lean</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 16px;">We take it a step further. Lean is how we
				<strong>live</strong>, let alone build stuff. We
				<em>'build, measure, learn, repeat'</em>and never raise funds without setting it right.</p>
					<p style="font-size: 16px;">Bootstrapping has its own entrepreneurial lessons that cannot be learnt without self experiencing them. We iterate, customer validate and reiterate. If we fail, we also fail fast, we re-iterate even faster and all of that, at minimum cost implications. In short we make sure we customer validate the products before we look to move to the next steps of development.

                          mind, write a book, but if you have a great plan, build an enterprise, be an entrepreneur, be
                          the change and then make that change with daily hustle. Our work will encourage you to dive in

                        Lakhs or $20,000 up to $ 100,000, you could go and find an angel investor yourself. All you got

                        other very smart people are going to get involved. We may be happy to help if we like your team,

                      Imagine a place for extra-ordinary people who have full access to their dreams. All the resources
                      are made available to them and they have all the freedom to bring out the best in them. Yes,
                      <strong> we
                        are talking about a co-living for extra-ordinary people</strong>. <br><br>
                      We would like to build a community of all those crazy talented individuals who when pulled
                      together can produce revolutionary technology products. We will choose those best ones from our
                      campaigns and provide them a platform through a co-living and co-working away from the city, even
                      if within a city. Such will be the environment and surroundings of such a place. <br><br>
                      Another co-founder of Preseed Prints, Paras Pundir, has this to say after understanding my vision
                      and launch strategy of it, âWe strongly believe that there is a need of this unique kind of
                      community in India. Many will be there who would like to become a part of this revolution and from
                      there comes the idea of crowdfunding this campaign with the best content and networks. Mostly it
                      will be provided by Nishchal. We will run this campaign over one of the best crowdfunding platform
                      called Indiegogo. We plan to make this campaign reach more than one lakh appropriate people in
                      India. <br><br>
                      About myself, having a keen interest in building communities and helping people to bring out their
                      best, Iâll be taking care of all the marketing and community building activities. In past, I have
                      built few most engaging communities from the scratch say a community of Product Managers, Quality
                      Analysts, UX designers, Community Managers, footballers and a little more. I have been helping
                      other startups and community persons in keeping their big communities alive. I would be very much
                      interested in this community of extra-ordinariesâ.

                      <h4>Preseed E-cell Spaces</h4>

                      In todayâs age of simple and well designed web tools for collaboration, if one starts using them
                      well, no one would really require to book office spaces when they are a team of 2â3 working out of
                      their homes. However, each in the team needs to be intrinsically motivated to do so. Remote
                      working is the future of boundless collaborations. <br><br>
                      Am I saying that people donât need offices? I am saying that people donât need offices
                      prematurely. They need offices when absolutely necessary. Otherwise, they should just bootstrap
                      their style of work. <br><br>
                      When it becomes absolutely necessary they should come and spend sometime at a place like Preseed
                      E-cell Spaces. <br><br>
                      <i>We are helping build this space further with a simple thought in our minds, that if about over
                        50
                        crazy ones who are building things with us are placed under one roof every single day, an
                        incredible amount of learning can take place. <br><br>
                        We really do feel that working in isolation of the vibe of the progressive conversations takes
                        away the possibility of incredibly valuable advise and perspectives.</i> <br><br>
                      Preseed E-cell spaces are a proposed cafe, co-working and co-living where you could come and co
                      create with others like you and us. This space is that environment we have always envisioned as a
                      required creative space for a budding entrepreneur. A place where you could come and spend your
                      time collaboratively and creatively at. <br><br>
                      Through such space we aim to create an open environment for co creation and innovation. Over a
                      period of time we hope to be the place you brainstormed all stages of your startup at. <br><br>
                      In Preseed Ecell spaces, you start, unlike your college where you do everything but start. We
                      clearly believe that entrepreneurship is not something that can be taught in a classroom full of
                      structured courses common for all. Entrepreneurship is a drive that occurs through self motivation
                      arising out of your own story. It canât be taught by professors at colleges. Here we just hope to
                      create a âgo to placeâ for you where you could start.

                        on how you want to approach your journey ahead. Having said that, in our hind sight we do

                      The difference between boot camps, Incubators or any other entrepreneurship initiative and
                      <strong> Preseed
                        E-cell spaces</strong> is that this space is not something that finishes like an event does.
                      Once an event
                      finishes what happens to the âEntrepreneurâ, where does he go thereafter. Preseed ecell space is a
                      place that remains and you can come here as many times you want. It never finishes on you.
                      <br><br>
                      <h2>Event Protocol</h2>
                      <h3>
                        There are four basic recurring events within preseed:-
                      </h3>



                      1. Delhi Meetup: <br>
                      Record the names and agendas of the ones who are the most important during the meetup.
                      <br><br>2. Demo Day: <br>
                      The first demo day, is when the startups who are already sort of up and running will come and they
                      will get to know in one session what Preseed is all about and how Preseed can help them. After
                      this
                      on the same day there will be one on one meetings with the people who want to talk about their
                      association or plan with preseed. The startups who require straight away investing will then be
                      shortlisted for the Investorâs Demo Day after 7 days. The ones that need help to bootstrap will
                      meet
                      with Nischal and discuss their plan with Preseed from then on.
                      <br><br>3. Investors Demo Day: <br>
                      On this day, the startups that require investing will be invited to demonstrate their business
                      plan
                      to a panel of interested investors and funds. They will be shortlisted from here by the investors
                      for funding. Here are the protocols.

                      Todoed is made up of I(could be the ceo) and Dhaval(could be the cto) full time. And
                      there are two
                      part time advisors (passive tech advisor&hairsp;-&hairsp;Saikiran and fairly active tech advisor/hands
                      on
                      coder/backend Ansal). <br>
                      This is the Todoed core team&hairsp;-&hairsp;I and Dhaval. This is all I need. This, all the way to
                      cover,
                      chrome extension(all to do with text&hairsp;-&hairsp;75% done) and iOS (all to do with voice and
                      text). This is
                      the iOS/backend/marketing/design team. <br>
                      It is Todoed on iOS that ultimately will solve my own problem fully that I envisioned it
                      to do for
                      me first. Todoed as a chrome extension has been able to do it only partly. <br>
                      I started my journey to inspire ideas, faith (in each other), and action among all I
                      come in
                      contact with. So, I started Preseed. Found Dhaval on that journey and mandated him to
                      build upon
                      my vision for the product, that productifies Preseed, to enable more potential
                      entrepreneurs to
                      build. The prototype is here <a href="http://myidealist.co">www.myidealist.co</a> . Now
                      while
                      journeying over this I realised a problem with my own fellows and community at Preseed,
                      where
                      actionable tasks sent over chat, kept getting lost. I told Dhaval to transfer the task
                      of building
                      MyIdealist to our other coworkers at Preseed and join me asap at building Todoed. <br>
                      In brief the above paragraph should give you a glimse over my exact motivation: <br><br>
                      1. To make people more productive. <br>
                      2. For the purpose of building ideas. <br> <br>
                      Todoed should help people be more productive for the purpose of building ideas. Some day
                      a text
                      with '#idea' in Todoed will create more possibilities for users of Todoed to transition
                      that idea
                      into a MVP and then perhaps a startup. That day Todoed and MyIdealist will be very
                      closely
                      integrated. But this year, that can even be a part of dialogue. Because this year is
                      about
                      everything in Todoed except this '#idea'.
                      <br> &hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;-&hairsp;- <br>
                      This is Todoed being built for the present or what I call 'the Todoed operational
                      parallel': <br>
                      <br>
                      We get tremendous invaluable support from Preseed, the noise free community of self
                      inspired
                      potential entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs, I started 3 years ago. That support will
                      continue
                      forever. That support means the ball at Todoed is always rolling. The hustle is always
                      on.
                      Independent of money, office, materials. It's a bonus. Large bonus. That is capable of
                      producing
                      the product, even if Dhaval and I were not there. (But Dhaval is there, has been and
                      will be,
                      forever, so had/have/will I. I have shared a profound and deeply action oriented
                      relationship with
                      Dhaval for 2 years now). <br>
                      Preseed is now represented through Govind, coordinator at Preseed; to Raj, who handles
                      Todoed at
                      Preseed, and hence is the coordinator at Todoed, meaning Raj's mandate is to extract the
                      juices
                      out of the Preseed team/network for the purpose of building Todoed, independent of the
                      works of
                      the core team of Todoed. <br>
                      Operational parallel: Raj; under my day to day directions and suggestions in freelance
                      arrangement
                      with Ansal, and advisory from Kartik Mandavidalle; with an open access to human
                      resources of
                      Preseed. This is how we have so far, Built the chrome extension; measuring it, learning
                      it,
                      repeating it. All the way to making it the best productivity chrome extension in the
                      world. This
                      is truly exactly the process that built Todoed thus far. And that is the exact process
                      that will
                      continue to build it further over the next 3 months. <br>
                      We think our chrome extension will be perfect by that time. While this is going on, Raj
                      will
                      continue to market the product and study the user metric and behavior. And then further
                      market it
                      upon those lessons. This is all about the Chrome extension. <br>
                      So there is also Raj in the Todoed team. He was my second in command at Preseed. Now he
                      is my
                      second in command in Todoed. <br>
                      Three of us are building Todoed at 0 costs to Todoed, from our own homes, I in Lucknow,
                      Raj in
                      Kolkatta, Dhaval in Ranchi. Whatever little server/freelancer costs, Preseed/Preseed
                      network takes
                      care of it. That is how we have done things and can do for a long period of time. We
                      are,in one
                      regard, self sustained. <br>
                      However, if we raise money, I can raise the bar -: <br> <br>
                      <br> 1. I want to set up a beautiful conducive office/infrastructure in Lucknow to come
                      under one
                      roof to build and grow a great roof to work from, physically also together, not just
                      mentally.
                      <br> 2. Build the product to my satisfaction in 3 months, and take I and Dhaval to
                      Silicon Valley
                      (leaving Raj and others to hustle in India), to work closely with a marketer/growth
                      hacker who has
                      been there done that. We want to go to him with a product, which is ready to be marketed
                      at his
                      full ability. I have the vision for the product, which can attract among the best
                      marketers and
                      growthhackers in the world, if we can compensate them suitablly. (This is a 100%
                      consumer web 100%
                      tech product and there is no reason for me to not build it from the place and in the
                      neighbourhood
                      of people who have done it the best).

                amongst the most progressive startup community. For the office space, if we can have that,
                we are already building a network there, to send the founders of the startups, who will be
                ready to be accelerated. If initially we can't have that space, they can be accelerated from
                Silicon Valley(by our manager & board of advisors sitting there) while they are in India.
                Look at our portfolio opportunities, and if you feel there can be future values made out of
                this & even if one is successful, and you think its worth your time, then please come on
                board. Sharing substantial portions of this business with you or anyone you recommend will
                be our pleasureâ-âwe can come on papers almost immediately to have this deal.
